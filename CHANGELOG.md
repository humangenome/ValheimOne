# Changelog

All notable changes to ValheimOne will be documented in this file. This project follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and intends to use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) after its first release.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Initial `net472` BepInEx plugin scaffold for Valheim 0.221.12.
- Original typed, section-based configuration framework with default-off feature gates and modifier-percent support.
- Central feature registry with server-authoritative, client-required, and client-only classifications.
- Working opt-in `PlayerCarryWeight` Harmony module as the first end-to-end gameplay example.
- Safe game-version detection, startup diagnostics, and a config-watcher stub.
- Routed-RPC version enforcement with an optional vanilla-client gate and grace period.
- Ack-gated server config transfer with non-persistent, non-ClientOnly client overlays.
- Startup-installed, runtime-gated feature patches so synced config can enable client modules safely.
- Build script, project documentation, contribution guidance, and MIT license.
- Opt-in `LiveMap` module: background seed-to-tiles world render (north-up Leaflet tile pyramid cached on disk), embedded HTTP server with `/api/status` and `/api/players` (honoring in-game position privacy), and a dark self-contained live map page with player markers and day/time readout.
